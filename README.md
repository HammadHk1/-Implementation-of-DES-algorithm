# Implementation of DES algorithm
## Introduction
This project aims to implement the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in response to their failure during the US-Vietnam War. The DES algorithm was created to provide a secure scheme for encryption and decryption of sensitive data. Initially published as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States, DES served as a widely used encryption standard until the introduction of AES.
The encryption process consists of 16 rounds, where each round takes the output of the previous round as input. Starting with the plaintext in the first round, it combines with the encryption key to produce the encrypted text. This encrypted text becomes the input for the second round, and the process continues until the completion of round 16. By implementing this DES algorithm, you will be able to encrypt data securely using the established encryption scheme.
